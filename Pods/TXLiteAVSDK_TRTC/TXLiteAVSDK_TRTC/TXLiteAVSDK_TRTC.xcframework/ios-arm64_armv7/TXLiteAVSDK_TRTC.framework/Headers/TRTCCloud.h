/**
 * 2.1 Enter room
 *
 * All TRTC users need to enter a room before they can "publish" or "subscribe to" audio/video streams. "Publishing" refers to pushing their own streams to the cloud, and "subscribing to" refers to pulling the streams of other users in the room from
 * the cloud. When calling this API, you need to specify your application scenario ({@link TRTCAppScene}) to get the best audio/video transfer experience. We provide the following four scenarios for your choice:
 * - {@link TRTCAppSceneVideoCall}:
 *    Video call scenario. Use cases: [one-to-one video call], [video conferencing with up to 300 participants], [online medical diagnosis], [small class], [video interview], etc.
 *    In this scenario, each room supports up to 300 concurrent online users, and up to 50 of them can speak simultaneously.
 * - {@link TRTCAppSceneAudioCall}:
 *    Audio call scenario. Use cases: [one-to-one audio call], [audio conferencing with up to 300 participants], [audio chat], [online Werewolf], etc.
 *    In this scenario, each room supports up to 300 concurrent online users, and up to 50 of them can speak simultaneously.
 * - {@link TRTCAppSceneLIVE}:
 *    Live streaming scenario. Use cases: [low-latency video live streaming], [interactive classroom for up to 100,000 participants], [live video competition], [video dating room], [remote training], [large-scale conferencing], etc.
 *    In this scenario, each room supports up to 100,000 concurrent online users, but you should specify the user roles: anchor ({@link TRTCRoleAnchor }) or audience ({@link TRTCRoleAudience }).
 * - {@link TRTCAppSceneVoiceChatRoom}:
 *    Audio chat room scenario. Use cases: [Clubhouse], [online karaoke room], [music live room], [FM radio], etc.
 *    In this scenario, each room supports up to 100,000 concurrent online users, but you should specify the user roles: anchor ({@link TRTCRoleAnchor }) or audience ({@link TRTCRoleAudience }).
 * After calling this API, you will receive the `onEnterRoom(result)` callback from {@link TRTCCloudDelegate}:
 *  - If room entry succeeded, the `result` parameter will be a positive number (`result` > 0), indicating the time in milliseconds (ms) between function call and room entry.
 *  - If room entry failed, the `result` parameter will be a negative number (`result` < 0), indicating the {@link TXLiteAVError} for room entry failure.
 * @param param Room entry parameter, which is used to specify the user's identity, role, authentication credentials, and other information. For more information, please see {@link TRTCParams}.
 * @param scene Application scenario, which is used to specify the use case. The same {@link TRTCAppScene} should be configured for all users in the same room.
 * @note
 *   1. If `scene` is specified as {@link TRTCAppSceneLIVE} or {@link TRTCAppSceneVoiceChatRoom}, you must use the `role` field in {@link TRTCParams} to specify the role of the current user in the room.
 *   2. The same `scene` should be configured for all users in the same room.

 * - If the user's role is `anchor`, the API will retain the current audio/video publishing status while switching the room; therefore, during the room switch, camera preview and sound capturing will not be interrupted.
 * This API is suitable for the online education scenario where the supervising teacher can perform fast room switch across multiple rooms. In this scenario, using `switchRoom` can get better smoothness and use less code than `exitRoom + enterRoom`.
 * The API call result will be called back through `onSwitchRoom(errCode, errMsg)` in {@link TRTCCloudDelegate}.
 * @param config Room parameter. For more information, please see {@link TRTCSwitchRoomConfig}.

/**
 * 2.6 Request cross-room call
 *
 * By default, only users in the same room can make audio/video calls with each other, and the audio/video streams in different rooms are isolated from each other.
 * However, you can publish the audio/video streams of an anchor in another room to the current room by calling this API. At the same time, this API will also publish the local audio/video streams to the target anchor's room.
 * In other words, you can use this API to share the audio/video streams of two anchors in two different rooms, so that the audience in each room can watch the streams of these two anchors. This feature can be used to implement anchor competition.
 * The result of requesting cross-room call will be returned through the {@link onConnectOtherRoom} callback in {@link TRTCCloudDelegate}.
 * For example, after anchor A in room "101" uses `connectOtherRoom()` to successfully call anchor B in room "102":
 * - All users in room "101" will receive the `onRemoteUserEnterRoom(B)` and `onUserVideoAvailable(B,YES)` event callbacks of anchor B; that is, all users in room "101" can subscribe to the audio/video streams of anchor B.
 * - All users in room "102" will receive the `onRemoteUserEnterRoom(A)` and `onUserVideoAvailable(A,YES)` event callbacks of anchor A; that is, all users in room "102" can subscribe to the audio/video streams of anchor A.
 * ![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/c5e6c72fc163ad5c0b6b7b00e1da55b5.png)
 * For compatibility with subsequent extended fields for cross-room call, parameters in JSON format are used currently.
 * Case 1: numeric room ID
 * If anchor A in room "101" wants to co-anchor with anchor B in room "102", then anchor A needs to pass in {"roomId": 102, "userId": "userB"} when calling this API.

 * <pre>

 *
 * Case 2: string room ID
 * If you use a string room ID, please be sure to replace the `roomId` in JSON with `strRoomId`, such as {"strRoomId": "102", "userId": "userB"}
 * Below is the sample code:

 * still need to bind the rendering control through the `startRemoteView` API).
 * - Manual subscription: after room entry, the user needs to manually call the {@link startRemoteView} API to start subscribing to and decoding the video stream and call the {@link muteRemoteAudio} (NO) API to start playing back the audio stream.
 * In most scenarios, users will subscribe to the audio/video streams of all anchors in the room after room entry. Therefore, TRTC adopts the automatic subscription mode by default in order to achieve the best "instant streaming experience".
 * In your application scenario, if there are many audio/video streams being published at the same time in each room, and each user only wants to subscribe to 1–2 streams of them, we recommend you use the "manual subscription" mode to reduce the
 * traffic costs.
 * @param autoRecvAudio YES: automatic subscription to audio; NO: manual subscription to audio by calling `muteRemoteAudio(NO)`. Default value: YES
 * @param autoRecvVideo YES: automatic subscription to video; NO: manual subscription to video by calling `startRemoteView`. Default value: YES
 * @note
 * 1. The configuration takes effect only if this API is called before room entry (enterRoom).
 * 2. In the automatic subscription mode, if the user does not call {@link startRemoteView} to subscribe to the video stream after room entry, the SDK will automatically stop subscribing to the video stream in order to reduce the traffic consumption.

/**
 * 2.9 Create room subinstance (for concurrent multi-room listen/watch)
 *
 * `TRTCCloud` was originally designed to work in the singleton mode, which limited the ability to watch concurrently in multiple rooms.
 * By calling this API, you can create multiple `TRTCCloud` instances, so that you can enter multiple different rooms at the same time to listen/watch audio/video streams.
 * However, it should be noted that your ability to publish audio and video streams in multiple `TRTCCloud` instances will be limited.
 * This feature is mainly used in the "super small class" use case in the online education scenario to break the limit that "only up to 50 users can publish their audio/video streams simultaneously in one TRTC room".
 * Below is the sample code:
 * <pre>
 *     //In the small room that needs interaction, enter the room as an anchor and push audio and video streams
 *     TRTCCloud *mainCloud = [TRTCCloud sharedInstance];
 *     TRTCParams *mainParams = [[TRTCParams alloc] init];

 * - Two devices cannot use the same `userId` to enter the same room with a specified `roomId`.

 * - The same user can push streams in multiple `TRTCCloud` instances at the same time, and can also call APIs related to local audio/video in the sub instance. But need to pay attention to:
 *     - Audio needs to be collected by the microphone or custom data at the same time in all instances, and the result of API calls related to the audio device will be based on the last time;

 * Note that this API can only be called by the anchor who is conducting the cross-room call, and the restrictions set by this API will be reset when the cross-room call is interrupted or the corresponding anchor leaves the room.
 * The result of calling this API will be returned through the `onUpdateOtherRoomForwardMode()` callback in {@link TRTCCloudDelegate}.
 * For example, in room "101", there is anchor A and audience B, and in room "102", there is anchor C who publishes audio/video streams normally. Anchor A calls `connectOtherRoom()` to make a cross-room call with anchor C.
 * - At this time, both anchor A and audience B will receive the `onRemoteUserEnterRoom(C)`, `onUserVideoAvailable(C,YES)`, and `onUserAudioAvailable(C,YES)` event callbacks, and can subscribe to the audio/video streams of anchor C.
 * Later, anchor A calls this API to disable the audio publishing capability of anchor C in the current room.
 * - After that, the audio stream of anchor C will no longer be published to room "101", and both anchor A and audience B will receive the `onUserAudioAvailable(C,NO)` event callback, and cannot subscribe to the audio stream of anchor C by calling
 * `muteRemoteAudio(C,NO)`.
 * - The video stream of anchor C will not be affected. The other audience members in Room 102 will not be affected and can subscribe to the audio stream of anchor C normally.

 * @param params The encoding settings. This parameter is required if you transcode and publish the stream to a CDN or to a TRTC room. If you relay to a CDN without transcoding, to improve the relaying stability and playback compatibility, we
 * recommend you set this parameter. For details, see {@link TRTCStreamEncoderParam}.

 * this API, passing in the task ID to switch the relaying task to a transcoding task. This can ensure that the live stream and CDN playback are not interrupted (you need to keep the encoding parameters consistent).

 * Before calling this API, you need to first enable custom audio playback using {@link enableCustomAudioRendering}.

 * - `sampleRate`: sample rate (required). Valid values: 16000, 24000, 32000, 44100, 48000
 * - `channel`: number of sound channels (required). `1`: mono-channel; `2`: dual-channel; if dual-channel is used, data is interleaved.
 * - `data`: the buffer used to get audio data. You need to allocate memory for the buffer based on the duration of an audio frame.
 *         The PCM data obtained can have a frame duration of 10 ms or 20 ms. 20 ms is recommended.
 * 		Assume that the sample rate is 48000, and sound channels mono-channel. The buffer size for a 20 ms audio frame would be 48000 x 0.02s x 1 x 16 bit = 15360 bit = 1920 bytes.
 * @param audioFrame Audio frames
 * @note
 *   1. You must set `sampleRate` and `channel` in `audioFrame`, and allocate memory for one frame of audio in advance.
 *   2. The SDK will fill the data automatically based on `sampleRate` and `channel`.
 *   3. We recommend that you use the system’s audio playback thread to drive the calling of this API, so that it is called each time the playback of an audio frame is complete.

 * 11.1 Use UDP channel to send custom message to all users in room
 *
 * This API allows you to use TRTC's UDP channel to broadcast custom data to other users in the current room for signaling transfer.

 * @param cmdID Message ID. Value range: 1–10

 * @param reliable Whether reliable sending is enabled. Reliable sending can achieve a higher success rate but with a longer reception delay than unreliable sending.
 * @param ordered Whether orderly sending is enabled, i.e., whether the data packets should be received in the same order in which they are sent; if so, a certain delay will be caused.
 * @return YES: sent the message successfully; NO: failed to send the message.
 * @note
 * 1. Up to 30 messages can be sent per second to all users in the room (this is not supported for web and mini program currently).

 * 3. A client can send up to 8 KB of data in total per second.
 * 4. `reliable` and `ordered` must be set to the same value (`YES` or `NO`) and cannot be set to different values currently.

/**
 * 11.2 Use SEI channel to send custom message to all users in room
 *
 * This API allows you to use TRTC's SEI channel to broadcast custom data to other users in the current room for signaling transfer.
 * The header of a video frame has a header data block called SEI. This API works by embedding the custom signaling data you want to send in the SEI block and sending it together with the video frame.
 * Therefore, the SEI channel has a better compatibility than {@link sendCustomCmdMsg} as the signaling data can be transferred to the CSS CDN along with the video frame.
 * However, because the data block of the video frame header cannot be too large, we recommend you limit the size of the signaling data to only a few bytes when using this API.
 * The most common use is to embed the custom timestamp into video frames through this API so as to implement a perfect alignment between the message and video image (such as between the teaching material and video signal in the education scenario).
 * Other users in the room can receive the message through the `onRecvSEIMsg` callback in {@link TRTCCloudDelegate}.
 * @param data Data to be sent, which can be up to 1 KB (1,000 bytes)
 * @param repeatCount Data sending count
 * @return YES: the message is allowed and will be sent with subsequent video frames; NO: the message is not allowed to be sent
 * @note This API has the following restrictions:
 * 1. The data will not be instantly sent after this API is called; instead, it will be inserted into the next video frame after the API call.
 * 2. Up to 30 messages can be sent per second to all users in the room (this limit is shared with `sendCustomCmdMsg`).
 * 3. Each packet can be up to 1 KB (this limit is shared with `sendCustomCmdMsg`). If a large amount of data is sent, the video bitrate will increase, which may reduce the video quality or even cause lagging.
 * 4. Each client can send up to 8 KB of data in total per second (this limit is shared with `sendCustomCmdMsg`).
 * 5. If multiple times of sending is required (i.e., `repeatCount` > 1), the data will be inserted into subsequent `repeatCount` video frames in a row for sending, which will increase the video bitrate.
 * 6. If `repeatCount` is greater than 1, the data will be sent for multiple times, and the same message may be received multiple times in the `onRecvSEIMsg` callback; therefore, deduplication is required.
