/**
 * System volume type (for mobile devices only)
 * @deprecated This API is not recommended after v9.5.
 * Smartphones usually have two types of system volume: call volume and media volume.
 * - Call volume is designed for call scenarios. It comes with acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) and supports audio capturing by Bluetooth earphones, but its sound quality is average.
 *            If you cannot turn the volume down to 0 (i.e., mute the phone) using the volume buttons, then your phone is using call volume.
 * - Media volume is designed for media scenarios such as music playback. AEC does not work when media volume is used, and Bluetooth earphones cannot be used for audio capturing. However, media volume delivers better music listening experience.
 *            If you are able to mute your phone using the volume buttons, then your phone is using media volume.
 * The SDK offers three system volume control modes: auto, call volume, and media volume.
